Project History
---

TaskStep was originally designed by [Rob Lowcock](http://www.cunningtitle.com), who began the project in 2006. In March 2008, he handed it off to me ([eromba](https://www.github.com/eromba)), after I refactored much of the existing code base.

The code hasn't been touched since then (and it could use a complete rewrite), but I am leaving it here for the open-source masses. Please fork if you feel inspired -- I will gladly accept pull requests!
